# A Manual of Things I Take to Be True

## Simplicity should be a daily practice.
Simplify as many things as you can. Simplify your desires. Simplify your goals. Simply what you expect--from others, and from the world in general.
Every day, ask yourself: *what can I simplify?*
Simplification doesn't necessarily mean reducing. Sometimes you'll retain all of the things in your life, but you will have simplified the way you think about them. Don't underestimate how much that can help you.

## Give first, receive eventually.
Don't go into every interaction asking what you can get out of it. Be willing to provide value to others first, without stipulating what you expect to receive. On average, you will get enough in return.

## Favor asking questions, rather than making statements.
