<div class="introduction">
  
  <h1>Hello. Thank you for visiting.</h1>

<p>My name is Mike Sturm, and there are a few ways you might know me:</p>
<ul>
 
  <li><b>You've stumbled across one of my books&mdash;more recently <a href="https://mikesturm.net/wabi-sabi-way/"><i>The Wabi-Sabi Way</i></a> or <a href="https://mikesturm.net/bethinkdo/"><i>Be, Think, Do</i></a>.
<li><b>You have seen my <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15PUM1GRYXoXkuXDiGuWiF4ubWll441h8S-70ZnP25LM/edit?usp=sharing">fancy GTD spreadsheet</a> or taken <a href="http://skl.sh/2n30RCj">my course</a> on how to use it.</b><br>
In 2017 I wrote <a href="https://betterhumans.coach.me/how-to-implement-a-killer-gtd-system-in-google-sheets-ad9c9857a8bd">an article</a> on Medium about how I use a simple spreadsheet to run a version of David Allen's famous GTD productivity system. The response was (and still is) beyond what I ever expected. That led me to create <a href="https://skl.sh/2n30RCj">a course</a> made up of 12 videos that guide you through using the sheet to run the system for yourself.<br>
<br>
<li><b>You read one of my articles on Medium.<br>
</b> Most of my writing is about productivity, self-improvement, and life in this digital age. I have written for publications like <a href="https://betterhumans.coach.me/"><i>Better Humans</i></a>, <a href="https://medium.com/personal-growth"><i>Personal Growth</i></a>, and <a href="https://thecoffeelicious.com/"><i>The Coffeelicious</i></a>, among various others. I am also the co-founder and erstwhile editor of a wonderful publication called <a href="https://medium.com/the-junction"><i>The Junction</i></a>&mdash;where the real editorial work is done by the talented Matt Tomic<br>
<br>
<li><b>You have read and/or subscribed to <i>Woolgathering</i>.</b><br>
I am the editor-in-chief of <a href="https://mikesturm.net/woolgathering"><i>Woolgathering</i></a>, a (mostly) weekly e-mail newsletter in which I pull together ther seemingly disconnected threads of knowledge, and help you spin it into wisdom. A lofty goal, to be sure, but at the very least, I hope reading it helps you think differently.

 </ul>

    <p>I am available for hire&mdash;for both writing and speaking gigs. Interested parties should <a href="mailto:info@mikesturm.net">email me</a> to inquire about those opportunities.</p>
