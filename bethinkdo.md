<h2 class="subtitle">Distilling the Art and Science of Personal Growth Down to Its Elements</h2>


The journey has many names: personal growth, self-improvement, self-help. But everyone is familiar with it.
It's a journey that so many of us begin, but that--if you do it right--it really doesn't end. It's been written about so often that one hesitates to add one more volume to the already towering stack of books about it. And yet, I did just that.


I began writing about productivity and self-improvement in 2014. For about 4 years, my own journey on the path of personal development was informed by and expressed through that writing. But it wasn't until one session of year-end reflection that--at the behest of my always practical wife, Erin--I entertained putting together a book about that journey. As I began to comb through the 4 years of writing I had done, I began to see that every piece I wrote dealt with one or more of three things:
- being: your way of confronting the world, yourself, and others in it
- thinking: your way of conceiving of reality--both how it is, and how you'd like it to be
- doing: taking action, and creating change

This book is separated into 3 sections--one for each of the categories above. Each section is a collection of essays centered around those topics. Each short essay can be read on its own as part of a morning motivational routine, or as part of a progressively deeper journey into self-improvement.

Topics covered include:
- building a compassionate relationship with yourself
- ditching work-life "balance" for something better
- choosing values over goals
- getting others interested in you, and invested in your success
- using methods to think deeply and differently
- harnessing the power of journaling by leveraging different methods
- becoming truly and robustly open-minded
