## Thanks for Subscribing to *Woolgathering*

I appreciate you giving me some of your time, attention, and inbox space. I take the value of those 3 things seriously, and my commitment to you is to deliver a valuable email to your inbox each week (or so).

You should be receiving your first edition of the newsletter within the next week (or sooner). In the meantime, consider checking out these other things:

- My book [Be, Think, Do: Deeper Essays On Personal Development and Productivity](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07MQS2YHD?ref_=pe_3052080_276849420)
- [The Google Spreadsheet I created](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15PUM1GRYXoXkuXDiGuWiF4ubWll441h8S-70ZnP25LM/edit#gid=1997529391) for running a GTD in simple rows and columns.
- [My course](http://skl.sh/2n30RCj) on how to run GTD using a simple spreadsheet.
- [My page on Medium](https://medium.com/@MikeSturm)â€”where you can find my writing going back to 2015.
