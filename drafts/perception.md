---  


# The Subjective Turn of our Internet experience
## Social media has changed the paradigm of perception, and thus how we think about ourselves and each other

### Essay map
1. Perception prior to social media had 2 modes: **open perception** and **closed perception**.
  - **open perception** is real-time, real-world, and uncurated. It's in-person, a phone conversation, or video conference. Characterized by the near impossibility of one person to curate the experience of the others involved. Though I can lie to you, not say something, or perform, I can do nothing to manipulate the experiences you have.
  - **closed perception** {is this the right word?} is non-real time, not in person, non interactive. It is when I see the things you have chosen to show me, in the way you've chosen to show me, with the possibility of alterations in the space you're shown in, alterations to the flow of time through editing, and so on. Closed perception is marked by being edited, or at least editable. Basically any kind of written communication or communication through pre-recorded media were closed perception.
2. Whereas closed perception was not previously regarded as a reliable way guide to the way someone is, something about social media has changed that.
3. Social media is a medium of closed perception, but for some reason, many of those using it do not recognize it as such.
4. Because many don't see social media as closed perception, they use it in the same way that we use open perception--as the basis of evaluations of people's characters, motives, and reports of their actual lives, beliefs, and actions.
