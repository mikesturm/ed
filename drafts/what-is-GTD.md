title: What is GTD?
---  

In the simplest possible terms, GTD--or *Getting Things Done*--is a personal productivity system created by David Allen that aims to eliminate stress and anxiety by allowing you to efficiently and effectively define and organize the open loops of your life--so you can close them.

Again, just to drive the point home: GTD will help you to be more productive by giving you processes so you can do 3 prerequisites for getting work done:

- define
- organize
- plan

So what are open loops? Good question, but let's not get ahead of ourselves. Before we tackle the *what* of open loops, let's first tackle the *where* and the *why*. I'm talking about the sources of open loops in your life.


## The Sources of Open Loops in Your Life
If you consider yourself the type of person interested in personal productivity, you're probably "busy". That word has many meanings. One person's concept of "busy" is different from everyone else's, but what it probably menas is this: if you sat down right now and tried to clear your mind, a lot of different thoughts would pop into your head. Those thoughts are more than likely open loops. They're things you have started but not finished, not started, but you think you should, or things that you haven't thought of for a while, and you're not even sure what they mean to you, but they fell important or urgent.

If that sounds vague, crazy, and bewildering, it's because *it is*. Running around with so many undefined work in your head is--in the long run--debilitating. And that's precisely why something like GTD exists. 

### Desires

There are a lot of things that we desire. A simple definition of a **desire** is a mental attachment to a state of affairs that doesn't currently exist. The way a desire usually works is this:
- You don't have X
- You believe that you would be happier if you had X
- You believe that there is something (or things) that you can do to get X

That's where the open loop is created. The something (or things) that you believe can get you X becomes work that you haven't done, but feel you should do.


### Expectations

An expectation is basically a more evolved form of a desire. It's a mental attachment to a state of affairs that doesn't currently exist, but that you believe are going to. Unlike a desire, you may not want this state of affairs to exist--but you strongly believe it will.

Expectations form open loops in a similar way to desires, in that they create a perceived amount of work that you feel you should be doing.

- You expect X to happen
- You

### Commitments

### Every other Vaguely Committal Thing

If something is not a commitment--something you have told someone that you will bring about--it isn't really anything.
