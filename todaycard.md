## A Simple, Yet Scalable Personal Productivity System

# What does it mean to be productive *today*?

The Today Card is a simple productivity system that arms you with a way to answer that question. It's both a way to motivate you to be more productive, as well as a way to measure your productivity each day. It essentially does 3 key things:

- Acts as a physical source of **motivation** throughout the day
- Establishes a productivity **measurement** system that's based on your own terms
- Helps you **prioritize** each day and represent those priorities in a tangible way

It's easy to get started. All you need is a 3 x 5" lined index card (though other sizes can work), a piece of scratch paper, and something to write with.

# Getting Started

## Prep Your Card

1. Grab and index card and make it look like the picture below:

- Use whatever format you like for the date, just so long as you caputre both the day and date—as well as the year (which becomes important once you've been using this sytem for a long time).

- The "P" and "E" columns to the far right should be only big enough to fit a single-digit number in each, but not bigger. You'll want as much space to the left of them as you can have.

## Get Priroitizing

2. Grab a piece of paper and write down a list of the things that you believe are important to get done today—in no particular order.
