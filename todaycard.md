# The Today Card

### A Simple, Yet Scalable Personal Productivity System

# All You Need Is An Index Card

The Today Card is a productivity system designed around the simplest of tools: a 3 x 5 index card. It’s a card that starts as a simple task list, but becomes a whole lot more.
It's a way to motivate you to be more productive, as well as a way to measure your productivity each day. It does 3 simple but important things:

- Acts as a physical source of **motivation** throughout the day
- Establishes a productivity **measurement** system based on what’s important to you
- Helps you **prioritize** each day and represent those priorities in a tangible way

It's easy to get started. Just grab a lined index card and something to write with.

# Day 1: Getting Started

In its simplest form, the Today Card system centers around these 6 activities:

1. Assemble a list of your (at most) 9 most important items to do today.
2. Assign a possible points value to each item based on its importance.
3. Commit to doing only what’s on that card unless something unforeseen and more important comes up.
4. As you complete each item, cross it off and award yourself the points for it.
5. At the end of the day, calculate your points and your effective batting average.
6. Track you batting average each day in the spreadseheet. Shoot for a minimum .750 batting average. As you consistently hit 1.000, consider refining your system.

## Prep Your Card

Grab a lined 3x5 index card and make it look like the picture below:

- Use whatever format you like for the date, just so long as you capture both the day and date—as well as the year (which becomes important once you've been using this system for a long time).

- The "P" and "E" columns to the far right should be only big enough to fit a single-digit number in each, but not bigger. You'll want as much space to the left of them as you can have.

- The back of the card (without lines) will remain blank for now.

## Fill Out Your First Card

1. Flip the index card to the unlined side, and position it like so:

<img src ="{{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/assets/portrait-card.png" alt=“back” style="max-height: 25rem;"/>

 2. Take 5 minutes and write on that blank side of the card a list of the things that you believe are important to get done today—in no particular order. By "important" I mean things that may not be urgent, but things that will move forward your most worthy goals or projects. 

3. Flip back to the lined side of the card. Place a number "1" on the left hand side of your first line of the card. In that number one slot, write the most important task you can do today—one that will make the most impact on your most important goals.

4. Place a number "2" on the next line, and place the 2nd most important task on the line. It's the task that if you could only do 2 things today, would be right behind the first item you wrote down.

5. Repeat steps 1 and 2 for as many items as you deem important for you to do today. One task per line. Your limit is 9.

6. Once you have all the items on your card, place the number of the last item on your list in the "P" column of the first item. For instance, if you have 7 items on your list, item 1 gets 7. Item 2 gets 6, and so on down to item 7—which gets 1.

This represents your possible points for each tasks, and the P values of those items summed up represents your total points for the day.

## Tips for Filling Out Your Card

- Look at your calendar before you begin filling out your tasks, to understand how much time you have available to take care of tasks on your initial big list. If you’re in meetings, picking up and dropping off kids, making dinner, and cleaning up for all but 2 hours today—consider a maximum of 3 items. Don’t put yourself under undue pressure.
I like to use the rule of no more than 1.25 items per hour of free time.

- Favor *push* items over *pull* items.
A *push* item is one that you need to make happen, as opposed to going to a meeting that’s been set up already. A *pull* item is one that either happens due to habit, or takes little effort or motivaiton for you to do. Meeting with someone when the meeting is already on your calendar—that’s a pull item, and not worth putting on your card. The exception would be when you’re notoriously bad about making meetings—in which case, put it on the card to motivate you to finally follow through!

- Favor items that take longer than 15 minutes.
This isn’t a hard and fast rule, but it’s usually the best way to go. An exception is when a really important but difficult task might only take 5 minutes, but you really have to push yourself to do it. By all means, put it on the card. But I’ve found those instances are rare. Reserve the card for the things that take a decent amount of your day’s free time and energy.


## Score Yourself
A primary feature of the card is the points system. The "P" column is your possible points for today. The "E" column is your earned points. When you complete a task, cross it off and put the amount of points earned in the "E" column. 

If you made an honest effort, but only got the task halfway done, you can earn half the point value in the "P" column. So if you had 7 tasks for the day, and you were working on task #1 (which is worth 7 points), but you didn't get it totally completed, you can put 3.5 in the "E" column. I've found that this mitigates the possible harmful effects of all-or-nothing thinking that already derail so much of our productivity efforts.

As you complete the most important tasks on the list, you get points. As you complete lower priority items on the list, you get points—but not as many as for the higher priority items.

At the end of the day, add up your earned points and place that number in the bottom of the "E" column. Divide by the total number of "P" points. Place that decimal (highest score being 1.000) in the box at the center bottom. That decimal is your score for the day. It's your win %. It tells you how well you did at doing the things you identified as most important to you today.
