## A Simple, Yet Scalable Personal Productivity System

# What does it mean to be productive *today*?

The Today Card is a simple productivity system that arms you with a way to answer that question. It's both a way to motivate you to be more productive, as well as a way to measure your productivity each day. It essentially does 3 key things:

- Acts as a physical source of **motivation** throughout the day
- Establishes a productivity **measurement** system that's based on your own terms
- Helps you **prioritize** each day and represent those priorities in a tangible way

It's easy to get started. All you need is a 3 x 5" lined index card (though other sizes can work), a piece of scratch paper, and something to write with.

# Getting Started

## Prep Your Card

1. Grab and index card and make it look like the picture below:

- Use whatever format you like for the date, just so long as you capture both the day and date—as well as the year (which becomes important once you've been using this system for a long time).

- The "P" and "E" columns to the far right should be only big enough to fit a single-digit number in each, but not bigger. You'll want as much space to the left of them as you can have.

## Priroitize

2. Grab a piece of paper and write down a list of the things that you believe are important to get done today—in no particular order. By "important" I mean things that may not be urgent, but things that will move forward your most worthy goals or projects.

Don't get overwhelmed or let yourself fall down a rabbit hole. But also, don't stop before you capture some important things that you clearly know you want to get done today.

3. Place a number "1" on the left hand side of your first line of the card. In that number one slot, write the most important task you can do today—one that will make the most impact on your most important goals.

4. Place a number "2" on the next line, and place the 2nd most important task on the line. It's the task that if you could only do 2 things today, would be right behind the first item you wrote down.
