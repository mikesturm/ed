## A Simple, Yet Scalable Personal Productivity System

# What does it mean to be productive *today*?

The Today Card is a simple productivity system that arms you with a way to answer that question. It's both a way to motivate you to be more productive, as well as a way to measure your productivity each day. It essentially does 3 key things:

- Acts as a physical source of **motivation** throughout the day
- Establishes a productivity **measurement** system that's based on your own terms
- Helps you **prioritize** each day and represent those priorities in a tangible way

It's easy to get started. All you need is a 3 x 5" lined index card (though other sizes can work), a piece of scratch paper, and something to write with.

# Getting Started

## Prep Your Card

Grab and index card and make it look like the picture below:

- Use whatever format you like for the date, just so long as you capture both the day and date—as well as the year (which becomes important once you've been using this system for a long time).

- The "P" and "E" columns to the far right should be only big enough to fit a single-digit number in each, but not bigger. You'll want as much space to the left of them as you can have.

## Priroitize

1. Grab a piece of paper and write down a list of the things that you believe are important to get done today—in no particular order. By "important" I mean things that may not be urgent, but things that will move forward your most worthy goals or projects.

Don't get overwhelmed or let yourself fall down a rabbit hole. But also, don't stop before you capture some important things that you clearly know you want to get done today.

2. Place a number "1" on the left hand side of your first line of the card. In that number one slot, write the most important task you can do today—one that will make the most impact on your most important goals.

3. Place a number "2" on the next line, and place the 2nd most important task on the line. It's the task that if you could only do 2 things today, would be right behind the first item you wrote down.

4. Repeat steps 1 and 2 for as many items as you deem important for you to do today. One task per line. Your limit is 9.

5. Once you have all the items on your card, place the number of the last item on your list in the "P" column of the first item. For instance, if you have 7 items on your list, item 1 gets 7. Item 2 gets 6, and so on down to item 7—which gets 1.

This represents your possible points for each tasks, and the P values of those items summed up represents your total points for the day.


## The Points

A primary feature of the card is the points system. The "P" column is your possible points for today. The "E" column is your earned points. When you complete a task, cross it off and put the amount of points earned in the "E" column. 

If you made an honest effort, but only got the task halfway done, you can earn half the point value in the "P" column. So if you had 7 tasks for the day, and you were working on task #1 (which is worth 7 points), but you didn't get it totally completed, you can put 3.5 in the "E" column. I've found that this mitigates the possible harmful effects of all-or-nothing thinking that already derail so much of our productivity efforts.

As you complete the most important tasks on the list, you get points. As you complete lower priority items on the list, you get points—but not as many as for the higher priority items.

At the end of the day, add up your

# FAQ

## What goes on the card?
This is a simple question, but it's the most difficult to answer. The purpose of the card is to keep you focused on the important things that you could be doing today. Part of that is focusing on things that you wouldn't normally focus on.

To that extent, you need to make an important distinction between two kinds of actions: **pull actions** and **push actions**.

## Why only 9 items?

## How many items should I put on my card?
