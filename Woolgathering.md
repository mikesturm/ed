## Woolgathering: A weekly newsletter designed to make you think

Each week--for the most part--I craft an email meant to help make you step back and think a bit. In it, I include a brief reflection on a broader topic to help stimulate your thought process. I also include links to newer pieces of writing I've crafted, as well as interesting links to other writing around the internet.

Below is a selected archive of *Woolgathering*. If you like what you read, and are not already subscribed, please consider [doing so](http://eepurl.com/c8Nlzb).
