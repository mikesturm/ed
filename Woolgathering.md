**wool·gath·er·ing** noun    
\ˈwu̇l-ˌga-t͟h(ə-)riŋ\  
*indulgence in aimless thought or dreamy imagining; absentmindedness.  
synonyms:	daydreaming, building castles in the air, reverie, musing, abstraction, preoccupation, brown study.*

The term *woolgathering* once referred to the act of roaming fields on a pasture to gather loose pieces of wool that had gotten caught in fences, bushes, or the like. At some point, it became a way to refer to the reveries of a wandering mind--the implication being that such wandering was ultimately unproductive. This newsletter exists as a challenge to that sentiment. Some of the best insights I've had come from my wandering mind. Here, I share them--and others--with you.

Each week--for the most part--I craft an email meant to help make you step back and think a bit. In it, I include a brief reflection on a broader topic to help stimulate your thought process. I also include links to newer pieces of writing I've crafted, as well as interesting links to other writing around the Internet.
