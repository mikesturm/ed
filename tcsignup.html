<h2 class="subtitle">Help me build a simple, yet scalable 3 x 5 productivity system</h2>
<p>Thanks for your interest in helping me test and develop this new productivity system!</p>

<p>I'm excited about what I have so far, and look forward to sharing it with you. I want to get honest feedback from people who are looking to use it, so I can make it better and ultimately make something that will help as many people as I can.</p>

<p>It's a simple, scalable, customizable productivity system built for makers, managers, moguls, and everyone in between. I think it's greatâ€”because it's helped me immensely. But obviously, I'm biased. So I want the feedback of people doing all kinds of work, in all different kinds of situations.</p>

<p>I won't ask a lot of you. By signing up for this, you can expect to receive an initial email from me explaining the system, as well as a few other communications over the course of 2 months or so.</p>

<p>The beta testing process for the Today Card system is already in progress, but feel free to jump in, try it out for yourself, and provide feedback.</p>

<p>Simply enroll using the form below, and you'll receive everything you need to get started.</p>
