<h2 class="subtitle">A Simple, Yet Scalable Personal Productivity System</h2>


# All You Need Is An Index Card and a Few Minutes

The Today Card is a productivity system designed around the simplest of tools: a 3 x 5 index card. It’s a card that starts as a simple task list, but becomes a whole lot more.

It's designed to start by focusing only on what you can do today to move you toward where you want to be, and it builds out from there.

It's a way to motivate you to be more productive, as well as a way to measure your productivity each day. It does 3 simple but important things:

- Acts as a physical source of **motivation** throughout the day
- Establishes a productivity **measurement** system based on what’s important to you
- Helps you **prioritize** each day and represent those priorities in a tangible way

It's easy to get started. Just grab a lined index card and something to write with.

<button class="collapsible">Level 1: Getting Started</button>
<div class="content">
  In its simplest form, the Today Card system centers around these 6 activities:

1. Assemble a list of your (at most) 9 most important items to do today.
2. Assign a possible points value to each item based on its importance.
3. Commit to doing only what’s on that card unless something unforeseen and more important comes up.
4. As you complete each item, cross it off and award yourself the points for it.
5. At the end of the day, calculate your points and your effective batting average.
6. Track you batting average each day in the spreadseheet. Shoot for a minimum .750 batting average. As you consistently hit 1.000, consider refining your system.

## Prep Your Card

Grab a lined 3x5 index card and make it look like the picture below:

![front]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/assets/Card-Setup.png)


- Use whatever format you like for the date, just so long as you capture both the day and date—as well as the year (which becomes important once you've been using this system for a long time).

- The "P" and "E" columns to the far right should be only big enough to fit a single-digit number in each, but not bigger. You'll want as much space to the left of them as you can have.


## Fill Out Your First Card

1. Flip the index card to the unlined side, and position it like so:

    ![back]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/assets/portrait-card.png)

 2. Take 5 minutes and write on that blank side of the card a list of the things that you believe are important to get done today—in no particular order. By "important" I mean things that may not be urgent, but things that will move forward your most worthy goals or projects. *(note: If you're already using another productivity system or have a list of actions to do, you can simply pull items from that pre-existing list)*

3. Flip back to the lined side of the card. Place a number "1" on the left hand side of your first line of the card. In that number one slot, write the most important task you can do today—one that will make the most impact on your most important goals.

4. Place a number "2" on the next line, and place the 2nd most important task on the line. It's the task that if you could only do 2 things today, would be right behind the first item you wrote down.

5. Repeat steps 1 and 2 for as many items as you deem important for you to do today. One task per line. Your limit is 9 (for thoughts on why, check the FAQ below).

6. Once you have all the items on your card, place the number of the last item on your list in the "P" column of the first item. For instance, if you have 7 items on your list, item 1 gets 7. Item 2 gets 6, and so on down to item 7—which gets 1.

This represents your possible points for each task, and the P values of those items summed up represents your total points for the day.

## Tips for How to Fill Out Your Card

- **Be conscious of your calendar**\
Look at your calendar before you begin filling out your tasks, to understand how much time you have available to take care of tasks on your initial big list. If you’re in meetings, picking up and dropping off kids, making dinner, and cleaning up for all but 2 hours today—consider a maximum of 3 items. Don’t put yourself under undue pressure.\
I like to use the rule of no more than 1.25 items per hour of free time.

- **Favor *push* items over *pull* items.**\
A *push* item is one that you need to make happen, as opposed to going to a meeting that’s been set up already. A *pull* item is one that either happens due to habit, or takes little effort or motivation for you to do. Meeting with someone when the meeting is already on your calendar—that’s a pull item, and not worth putting on your card. The exception would be when you’re notoriously bad about making meetings—in which case, put it on the card to motivate you to finally follow through!

- **Favor items that take longer than 15 minutes.**\
This isn’t a hard and fast rule, but it’s usually the best way to go. An exception is when a really important but difficult task might only take 5 minutes, but you really have to push yourself to do it. By all means, put it on the card. But I’ve found those instances are rare. Reserve the card for the things that take a decent amount of your day’s free time and energy.

## Review and Vow

Review the items on your card in order. Take a deep breath in, and let it out slowly. Let it sink in that if you follow what's on this card, you can feel really good about how your day went. You’ve made the hard decisions. Now you just need to do the work.

Vow to yourself that this card will be your guide for the day. Commit to looking at it for guidance on what to work on next.


Now Get to work.


## Using the Scoring System
A primary feature of the card is the points system. The "P" column is your possible points for today. The "E" column is your earned points. When you complete a task, cross it off and put the amount of points earned in the "E" column. 

If you made an honest effort, but only got the task halfway done, you can earn half the point value in the "P" column. So if you had 7 tasks for the day, and you were working on task #1 (which is worth 7 points), but you didn't get it totally completed, you can put 3.5 in the "E" column. I've found that this mitigates the possible harmful effects of all-or-nothing thinking that already derail so much of our productivity efforts.

As you complete the most important tasks on the list, you get points. As you complete lower priority items on the list, you get points—but not as many as for the higher priority items.


## The End of the Day

Congratulations! You've made it to the end of your first day using the Today Card. Now it's time to tabulate your score, so you can see how well you did.

For each item you completed, be sure it's crossed off, and you've placed the point value in the "E" column for that item. If you put in real effort on an item, but didn't quite finish it, you can give yourself half of the possible point value for that item. You should get some credit for pushing yourself to work on it.

Add up your earned points and place that number in the bottom of the "E" column. Divide that by the total number of "P" points. Place that decimal (highest score being 1.000) in the box at the center bottom. That decimal is your score for the day. It's your win %. It tells you how well you did at doing the things you identified as most important to you today.

A fully scored card at the day’s end should look like this:

# Level 2  - Building Out

After Level 1, you'll benefit from building out a minimal system around the daily card.

1. Solidifying the habit of filling out the card each morning.
2. Keeping track of the potential items that could go on a card for any given day.
3. Using your score each day as a way to refine what you put on the card the next day.


## Build a M.E.P.S (Minimal External Productivity System)

The central component is the card. If you just do the card each day--using whatever other organizatioal system you have--that will still help you foucs. 

But it helps to have a system external to the card that feeds the right actions and priority levels into the card each day. It helps to have what I call a M.E.P.S (a Minimal External Productivity System). The good news is, you have the start of one already! It's whatever actions remain undone from the front and back of Day 1's card.

Your M.E.P.S consists of 3 simple components:

- A **Scheduled Master Action List** of all the things you want to get done, separated into 3 categories:
    - Next Few Days
    - This Week
    - Next Week and After
- A **Project List** that those actions serve, in 2 categories:
    - (G) Goal-related. It serves a goal of yours.
    - (NG) Non-goal related. It's just something you need to get done.
- A **Weekly Recap** (about 10 - 15 minutes) to do a few key things:
    - record and review your score in the [scorekeeping spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1P6VDieekSS-vji4CM5YRC9e0nGSANWNabx8_Zt8e0KA/edit?usp=sharing). You can also [download a .xls version of the sheet here](mikesturm.net/assets/Scorecard.xlsx).
    - Reflect on your batting average for the week, and decide if you need to adjust your strategy
    - review your action list, and move things on it in or out--depending on when you think you should try to do them.


## Use the M.E.P.S to get the most out of your card
In Level 1, I talked about making sure the first few items are really important ones to you. Building and maintaining a M.E.P.S makes it much easier to decide which items go on your card and in what order. The first 2 actions on your card (the ones with the highest point values) should be ones that relate to projects in the (G) category on your project list. The reason for this is that you should earn the most points for working on what moves *your* goals forward. That's what this system is all about.

Once you have a master action list and a project list categorized into (G) and (NG) projects, you can do some next-level card-creation.

It also helps to divide your big list of next actions into 3 relative timeframes: next few days, this week, next week and after. I've found this to be enough to help me pre-priotitize what's on my plate. This way, I don't have to look at a huge list of what *could* go on my card each day. I'm most likely going to pull things from the *next few days* category first.

Perhaps the most helpful thing you can do to get the most out of the Today Card is a weekly recap. You score yourself each day, but recording your score over the week--and comparing it with the previous week--can help you understand how you're doing, and where you need to make adjustments. Reviewing your master action list and doing some scheduling is also helpful. And of course, reviewing your list of projects, to see if any new actions need to happen. That's also going to help.

## The Back of the card
After Level 1--where you have your master action list--the back of the card becomes free for other things. I use mine for a combination of notes about the day, "drop-in" tasks I did that were important, but not on the front of the card, or things to remember. But it's free for whatever use you decide.



# FAQ

### Why an index card? Why not just a to-do list in a notebook or on an app?
I have 3 main reasons why I use a new index card every day, and I’m very passionate about them.
1. **It’s your best shot at avoiding distraction.**\
Even though social media and the internet in general get a bad rap for being sources of distraction, our own productivity systems can also be huge distractions. Planners, outlines, apps, and lists of projects and tasks can all distract you from what you should be doing now.\
\
   The card is meant to be separate from all that other stuff. It is its own thing. It is today. Keep it separate, and watch your focus and motivation get magnified.
        
2. **It’s a way to leverage the feeling of a fresh start.**\
    The reason why it’s important to have a brand new card is the same reason that it feels so great to have a brand new planner at the beginning of the year. When the place where you are trying to figure out what you need to do today is the same place as your leftover junk from yesterday and the weeks before, your mind knows this.\
    \
    But when your mind sees a fresh, new, separate blank piece of paper, it’s given permission to take things on with a fresh new attitude. Do not refuse to take advantage of this. A fresh card works in the same way that a fresh notebook or planner works. It just does this every single day.
    
3. **It’s portable and concrete.**\
    The fact that you can feel the card and carry it with you makes what you’ve put on it all the more real. It becomes a talisman for doing your best today. The card you’re carrying with you is the best you can do today. Everything else is icing on the cake. 

### Do I have to go to Level 2? Can I just make a card each day?
No, you don’t have to go to Level 2. You can stay at Level 1 and fill out a daily card for as long as it works for you. But when it doesn’t work as well, Level 2 might be a huge help. 

I love a good master productivity system as much as the next desk jockey, but I also recognize a brutal truth. The people who need a productivity system the most are often those who are least likely to succeed using a grand unified productivity system. It's too much, too soon. They still haven't learned how to feel good about today. That's what the card offers. 

You can be successful using only a card each day because it serves to focus and motivate you to put down in writing what’s important to do today, and makes it fun to push yourself to get it done today. That alone is worthwhile.

### What should go on the front of the card?
Great question. This is where there is a lot of room for making the system your own.

My answer is this: whatever makes it easiest for you to look at the card and be ready to start doing item #1 on it. As I do for many things, I'll defer to the great David Allen, and suggest you list the next physical action step that will move things forward on the important thing that made you want to put that action on the card. But I realize that such actions may only take a minute.

But, just because an action only takes a minute doesn't mean that it doesn't yield great value down the line. It also doesn't meant that it isn' timportant. So be aware of that. But there are some big actions that take a few steps, and you want to capture them as something shorter under 1 item on a card. My suggesiton is to use the first action that will get the ball rolling, and let the momentum of getting that done carry you. 

You could also use commas, write small, and sneak 3 related actions onto one line. It all depends on how you think, how you work, and your emotional state for that day.

### Why only 9 items?
Partly because that's the amount of lines on the index card. But also because I think there's power in trying to do fewer things, but the kinds of things that yield a higher return. To that end, stay within the constraints of the system until you're quite sure they no longer apply to you.

Are there days where you get more than 9 things done? Yes. Are more than 9 of those things the type of things that are really important *and* you have to really push yourself to get them done? I think that's highly unusual.

By and large, the items on the card are going to be the kind that take some significant time and energy for you to do. Again, the card isn't for everything you might do today, it’s just the things that, if you do them, you can feel really good about today. And usually, those things are time, labor, and emotionally intensive.

### How many items should I put on my card?
There's no easy answer to this question. A good rule of thumb is this: take the amount of hours you have free to work on these things today, multiply it by 1.25, and that's about the number of items to put on your list. This way, you have buffer time for things that drop-in (and they will), and you don't put yourself under a bunch of undue stress.

### Can I integrate something like timeblocking into the card?
Yes! I do this frequently. It's hard to know sometimes just how long a task will take, so I commit to putting in a solid hour or 90 minutes of work on something. That becomes an item on the card. It's helped me move forward on many projects where I usually would have procrastinated.

### Can I use the Today Card while using another productivity system (GTD, Bullet Journal, etc.)?
Absolutely. The card can be plugged into any existing productivity system, as a way to clarify what you should do today, and keep you focused and motivated on it. I still run something kind of like a GTD system, but the Today Card is how I take the information from that system and decide what to do today.
